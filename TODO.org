- To have a VPC into which one can launch EC2 instances, you have to go through the wizard, which auto-creates a number of different objects. 
** TODO Create a list of object types that are created by the EC2 Wizard (Checked means that 
- [ ] 1 VPC
- [ ] 1 Subnet
- [ ] 1 Network ACL
- [ ] 1 Security Group (for a total of 2, including default)
- [ ] 1 Internet Gateway
- [ ] 2 Route Tables (both created via the Wizard.)

** TODO Change this infrastructure to mimic that.
- I think this guy figured it out: https://github.com/hectcastro/terraform-aws-vpc/blob/feature/terraform-aws-vpc/aws-vpc.tf
